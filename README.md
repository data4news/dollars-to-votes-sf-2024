# Dollars To Votes

Mission Local looks to understand the relationship between dollars and votes in a 2024 local election.

## Background

You're a reporter at [Mission Local](https://missionlocal.org/) an independent San Francisco-based news site. The results have just come in for [local elections that were held on March 5, 2024](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2024/california-primary-election-results/san-francisco). One of the things on the ballot is the DCCC election, a committee that governs the local Democratic Party. 

Here's a bit of background information from the San Francisco Chronicle:

> Colloquially referred to as the “D-triple-C,” the DCCC governs the local Democratic Party. It’s made up of 24 elected members — 14 from the 17th Assembly District, which encompasses San Francisco’s east side, and 10 from the 19th Assembly District, which includes the city’s west side. It also has eight “ex-officio” members, consisting of San Francisco Democrats elected to state and federal offices.
>
> Every four years — during the primary election of a presidential election year — all elected DCCC seats are up for grabs and can be voted on by registered Democrats in San Francisco. 
>
> Often, this is a rather dull affair. Although the DCCC can be a stepping stone to higher office, it can nevertheless be a tough sell to potential candidates: The job has no salary, and it’s known for being a cutthroat political environment. 
>
> This year, however, the DCCC race is a marquee attraction. 
> 
> More than $2 million has been poured into the race by backers of the two main groups, or slates, of DCCC candidates — a potentially record sum. Most of that money comes from moderate tech-affiliated and labor groups supporting a moderate slate called SF Democrats for Change, which promises to restore “common sense” to a DCCC that it accuses of taking positions “out of sync with San Francisco voters,” including “defunding public safety initiatives” and refusing to take a stance on the 2022 school board recall. Labor groups, meanwhile, are backing the progressive Labor and Working Families slate, which promises to fight for a San Francisco “that works for everyone, not just the billionaires” and to protect the city from a reversion “back to failed Reagan-era policies.”
>
> There are 30 candidates running for 14 seats in the 17th district and 21 candidates fighting for 10 spots in the 19th.
> 
> Most of these candidates are running on the big slates. There are practical reasons for this: It’s extremely expensive for individual candidates to send out campaign mailers and ads. By joining forces and pooling funds, candidates can reach more people at a lower cost and benefit from the name recognition and political expertise of better-known contenders.
